import Heading from '@react/react-spectrum/Heading';


## Overview

**Headings** in Spectrum are available in several variations for different uses and multiple levels of loudness for various attention-getting needs just as a normal `heading` element in React. The `variant` property defines the heading analogous to the normal heading element in react. Eg. `variant="pageTitle"` refers to `<h2>` tag of HTML.

## Example

<Heading>React</Heading>

```jsx
<Heading>React</Heading>
```

## Variants

Headings in Spectrum are available in 5 variants, each having a different size and style. The "display" variant (default) should be used for main headings, followed by "pageTitle" variant headings, then the less important "subtitle1" variant headings. Three "subtitle" variants exist: "subtitle1", "subtitle2" and "subtitle3".

<Heading>React</Heading>
<Heading variant="pageTitle">React</Heading>
<Heading variant="subtitle1">React</Heading>
<Heading variant="subtitle2">React</Heading>
<Heading variant="subtitle3">React</Heading>

```jsx
<Heading>React</Heading>
<Heading variant="pageTitle">React</Heading>
<Heading variant="subtitle1">React</Heading>
<Heading variant="subtitle2">React</Heading>
<Heading variant="subtitle3">React</Heading>
```

## Internationalization

To internationalize a heading, a localized string should be passed as a child.
