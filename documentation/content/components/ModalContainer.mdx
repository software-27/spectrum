## Overview

To programmatically open a Modal, you can use the ModalContainer class.
```
ModalContainer.show(<Modal>...</Modal>, this);
```
`show` takes 3 arguments, a Modal, a context, and a container. Typically, `this`, is the context that should be provided
and container usually doesn't need to be specified, it will automatically go to the closest provider. It will
pick up the context as provided by the React Spectrum `<Provider>`. Do not wrap the `<Modal>` in a `<Provider>` as that
will result in the `<Modal>` not getting the right props.
