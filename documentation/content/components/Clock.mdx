import Clock from '@react/react-spectrum/Clock';
import FieldLabel from '@react/react-spectrum/FieldLabel';

## Overview

The **Clock** in Spectrum have several props for different uses and multiple levels of loudness for various attention-getting needs. It allows time in hour : minute

## Example

<Clock value="today" aria-label="Start time" />

```jsx
<Clock  value="today" aria-label="Start time" />
```

## Handling Events

Events handlers like onChange and other user actions can be registered on a `Clock`. A function that will be called when an clock is changed.

<Clock onChange={e => console.log(e)} aria-label="Start time" />

```jsx
<Clock onChange={e => console.log(e)}  aria-label="Start time" />
```

## Quiet Clock

Visual representation is changed for clocked with this prop.

<Clock quiet value="today" aria-label="Start time" />

```jsx
<Clock quiet value="today" aria-label="Start time"  />
```

## AM / PM

Handles AM / PM changes

<Clock defaultValue="today" displayFormat="hh:mm a" aria-label="Start time"  />


```jsx
<Clock defaultValue="today" displayFormat="hh:mm a" aria-label="Start time"  />
```

## Accessibility

The Clock component is treated as a fieldset containing two TextField components and, depending on the  <code>displayFormat</code>, a Select component for selecting between AM or PM.

When the Clock value is updated using one of the inputs, a live region will update to announce the full Clock time to assistive technology, and the fieldset label is updated to include the value.

### Labelling

The fields within the Clock component are labelled internally as "Hours", "Minutes" and "AM/PM" using the appropriate translated strings for the locale.

#### Using aria-labelledby

Labeling using a FieldLabel with labelFor and id, and aria-labelledby on the Clock ensures that the fieldset is labeled and clicking on the label will focus the hours field.

<div>
  <FieldLabel label="Start time" id="react-spectrum-1-label" labelFor="react-spectrum-1" />
  <Clock
    value="today"
    id="react-spectrum-1"
    aria-labelledby="react-spectrum-1-label"
  />
</div>

```jsx
  <FieldLabel label="Start time" id="react-spectrum-1-label" labelFor="react-spectrum-1" />
  <Clock
    value="today"
    id="react-spectrum-1"
    aria-labelledby="react-spectrum-1-label"
  />
```

#### Using aria-label

In a composite component, such as the Datepicker, the Clock can also be labelled using aria-label.

<Clock value="today" displayFormat="hh:mm a" aria-label="Start time"  />

```jsx
<Clock value="today" displayFormat="hh:mm a" aria-label="Start time"  />
```
