import Datepicker from '@react/react-spectrum/Datepicker';

## Overview

The `Datepicker` component is a textfield input with a button that opens a popover calendar for easy date selection.

### Example

<Datepicker />

```jsx
<Datepicker />
```

### Controlled

The controlled Datepicker is loaded with value prop that takes either String, Object or Number type. In below example the `Datepicker` is loaded with today's date.

<Datepicker  value="today" />

```jsx

<Datepicker  value="today" />
```

## Type

There are many Datepicker `types` to choose from in Spectrum. The default type is 'date'. Apart from that user can have `datetime`, `time`. These can also be used in combination with controlled type component.

### date
This is the default value for type prop. Opens up the calendar that allows selection of date and populates the same in input control.

<Datepicker type="date" />

```jsx
<Datepicker type="date" />
```

### datetime

The `type` prop with value `datetime` shows the popover with a calendar and input control to enter hour and minutes. Once selected the input box is populated with date and time.

<Datepicker type="datetime" />

```jsx
<Datepicker type="datetime" />
```

### time

The `type` prop with value 'time' shows only time. Validations for incorrect input values of time is shown by highlighting the input control with error class.

<Datepicker placeholder="Choose a time" type="time" />

```jsx
<Datepicker placeholder="Choose a time" type="time" />
```
