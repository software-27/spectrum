import Wait from '@react/react-spectrum/Wait';

## Overview

A **Wait** component provides a visual indicator that work is being done.

## Example

<Wait />

```jsx
import Wait from '@react/react-spectrum/Wait';

<Wait />
```

## Styling
### Sizing

<Wait size="S" />

```jsx
<Wait size="S" />
```

<Wait size="L" />

```jsx
<Wait size="L" />
```

### Alignment

Centers the wait in the container.
It is set with CSS, the parent needs to have "position: relative;" and it needs to take up the full vertical and horizontal space that the Wait should be centered into. If it is only taking up the full width, then it will get rendered at the "top" because the parent won't have a height as absolute removes the Wait from the flow.

There may also be an issue if used inside a dialog or any other parents in the hierarchy have the CSS transform applied, if that's the case, it's recommended to center it yourself using something like flexbox.

<div style={{height: '100px', position: 'relative'}}>
  <Wait centered />
</div>

```jsx
<Wait centered />
```

## Variants

### Over Background

For the case where the Wait is on top of some background color, you can set a "overBackground" variant.

<div style={{
  'width': '100px',
  'height': '100px',
  'background-color': 'rgba(0,0,0,0.4)',
  'display': 'flex',
  'align-items': 'center',
  'justify-content': 'center'}}>
  <Wait variant="overBackground" />
</div>

```jsx
<Wait variant="overBackground" />
```

## Indeterminate or Determinate

You can also set **Wait** component to be indeterminate (true by default) or determinate. A indeterminate **Wait** component would spin endlessly, as can be seen in previous examples, wheras a determinate **Wait** component would allow you to set the wait progress to a determined value.

### Determinate

<Wait indeterminate={false} value={42} />

```jsx
<Wait indeterminate={false} value={42} />
```

## Accessibility

The **Wait** component uses the aria **progressbar** role. It will not be read automatically by screen readers, and will only be voiced when navigating to it. 
If changes in the value should be communicated to screen readers, the aria-live attribute may be added. 
Be aware that when using aria-live each time the value changes it will be communicated to a screen reader user, which can be quite verbose, so this should be used with caution.

<Wait indeterminate={false} value={42} aria-live="polite"/>

```jsx
<Wait indeterminate={false} value={42} aria-live="polite" />
```
