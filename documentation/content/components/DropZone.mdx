import DropZone from '@react/react-spectrum/DropZone';
import IllustratedMessage from '@react/react-spectrum/IllustratedMessage';

A DropZone is an area on the screen into which an object can be dragged and dropped to accomplish a task. For example, a DropZone might be used in an upload workflow to enable the user to simply drop a file from their operating system into the DropZone, which is a more efficient and intuitive action, rather than utilize the standard "Choose File" dialog.

DropZones should be used with an [IllustratedMessage](/components/IllustratedMessage) component as a child if the drop zone is empty, otherwise the existing content should be passed as a child.

## Example

```jsx
<DropZone onDrop={() => alert('Dropped!')}>
  <IllustratedMessage
    heading="Drag and Drop Your Files"
    description="Drop your files here."
    illustration={<svg>...</svg>} />
</DropZone>
```

<DropZone onDrop={() => alert('Dropped!')}>
  <IllustratedMessage
    heading="Drag and Drop Your Files"
    description="Drop your files here."
    illustration={
      <svg viewBox="0 0 199 97.7" height="110">
        <g fill="none" strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeMiterlimit="10" strokeWidth="3px">

          <line x1="99.5" y1="95.5" x2="99.5" y2="58.5" />

        </g>

    } />
</DropZone>

## Internationalization

To internationalize an DropZone, localized children should be passed as needed.

## Accessibility

It is up to the application to ensure that there is an alternative method of accomplishing the task that the DropZone provides, such as a button with a file dialog. Drag and drop should never be the only way to interact with a feature.
