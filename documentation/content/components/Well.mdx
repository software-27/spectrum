import Heading from '@react/react-spectrum/Heading';
import Well from '@react/react-spectrum/Well';

## Overview

A **Well** visually separates its inner content from the upper level.

## Example

<Well>Jack is here waiting for help.</Well>

```jsx
<Well>Jack is here waiting for help.</Well>
```

## Accessibility

By default, the visual separation of a **Well** is not conveyed to assistive technologies. 
As such it should be used where this separation makes no difference in understanding the content.

However, if the Well does convey semantic meaning then a `role` must be specified and, if appropriate, labeled using either `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` 


### Using role

<Well role="region" aria-labelledby="wellLabel">
    <Heading id="wellLabel" variant="subtitle1">Shipping Address</Heading>
    <p>601 Townsend Street<br /> San Francisco, CA 94103</p>
</Well>

```jsx
<Well role="region" aria-labelledby="wellLabel">
    <Heading id="wellLabel" variant="subtitle1">Shipping Address</Heading>
    <p>601 Townsend Street<br /> San Francisco, CA 94103</p>
</Well>
```
