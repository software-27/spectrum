import Alert from '@react/react-spectrum/Alert';

## Overview

An **Alert** in Spectrum has several variations for different uses and multiple levels of loudness for various attention-getting needs.

## Example

Alerts have a number of props for controlling their visual state. This is the basic usage of the Alert.

<Alert>
This is a React Spectrum alert
</Alert>

```jsx
<Alert>
This is a React Spectrum alert
</Alert>
```
## Variants

There are many Alert variants to choose from in Spectrum. The `variant` prop controls the main variant of the alert.

### Info Variant

<Alert variant="info">
  This is a React Spectrum alert
</Alert>

```jsx
<Alert variant="info">
  This is a React Spectrum alert
</Alert>
```

### Success Variant

<Alert variant="success">
  This is a React Spectrum alert
</Alert>

```jsx
<Alert variant="success">
  This is a React Spectrum alert
</Alert>
```
### Warning Variant

<Alert variant="warning">
  This is a React Spectrum alert
</Alert>

```jsx
<Alert variant="warning">
  This is a React Spectrum alert
</Alert>
```

### Error Variant

<Alert variant="error">
  This is a React Spectrum alert
</Alert>

```jsx
<Alert  variant="error">
  This is a React Spectrum alert
</Alert>
```

## Header
Spectrum Alert with header prop.

<Alert header="Header 1">
  This is a React Spectrum alert
</Alert>

```jsx
<Alert header="Header 1">
  This is a React Spectrum alert
</Alert>
```
## Accessibility

### WAI-ARIA Design Pattern

The Alert component implements the Alert design pattern, per
[WAI-ARIA 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#alert).
By default it uses `role` `alert` and will announce as an
`assertive` live region. The `role` or `aria-live` politeness
setting can be overridden to use, for example, `aria-live="polite"`
or `aria-live="off"` rather than the implicit `assertive` politeness
setting.

<Alert header="With aria-live=&quot;polite&quot;" aria-live="polite">
  This is a React Spectrum alert that should announce politely.
</Alert>
<br/>
<Alert header="With aria-live=&quot;off&quot;" aria-live="off">
  This is a React Spectrum alert that should not announce.
</Alert>

```jsx
<Alert header="With aria-live=&quot;polite&quot;" aria-live="polite">
  This is a React Spectrum alert that should announce politely
</Alert>

<Alert header="With aria-live=&quot;off&quot;" aria-live="off">
  This is a React Spectrum alert that should not announce.
</Alert>
```

### Custom `alt` text for Icon

The Alert component uses a localized string derived on the `variant` prop to provide `alt` text to the Alert Icon, but this can be overridden by providing an `alt` prop.


<Alert header="You can customize alt text for the icon =&gt;" alt="Hint">
  This is a React Spectrum alert where the Icon uses custom alt text.
</Alert>

```jsx
<Alert header="You can customize alt text for the icon =&gt;" alt="Hint">
  This is a React Spectrum alert where the Icon uses custom alt text.
</Alert>
```
