import {Asset} from '@react/react-spectrum/Asset';

An **Asset** represents a preview of an item in a file system or collection, such as an image, file, or folder. Asset previews support
smart sizing to ensure that items of any aspect ratio look balanced as part of a collection. Assets also support advanced image loading
and caching to enable a better experience when displayed in a virtual scroller such as GridView or TableView.

## Images

Here is an example of an Asset that displays an image.

```jsx
import {Asset} from '@react/react-spectrum/Asset';

<Asset
  type="image"
  src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06640.jpg"
  alt="Sunset view of Paris featuring the Eiffel Tower as seen from the
  Montparnasse Tower 56th Floor Observation Deck" />
```

<div style={{'width':'208px', 'height':'208px'}}>
  <Asset type="image" src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06640.jpg" alt="Sunset view of Paris featuring the Eiffel Tower as seen from the Montparnasse Tower 56th Floor Observation Deck" />
</div>

## Files

Here is an example of an Asset that displays a file.

```jsx
import {Asset} from '@react/react-spectrum/Asset';

<Asset type="file" />
```

<div style={{'width':'208px', 'height':'208px'}}>
  <Asset type="file" />
</div>

## Folders

Here is an example of an Asset that displays a folder.

```jsx
import {Asset} from '@react/react-spectrum/Asset';

<Asset type="folder" />
```

<div style={{'width':'208px', 'height':'208px'}}>
  <Asset type="folder" />
</div>

## Smart Sizing

By default, Asset enables smart sizing, which adjusts the size of the asset preview within its container based on its aspect
ratio. This ensures that items of varying aspect ratios look balanced as part of a grid or list, rather than wide or tall items looking
smaller by comparison. This behavior can be controlled using the `smartness` prop, which is a factor between 0 and 1. Setting it to 0 disables
smartness, so that the asset can occupy the full size of its container.

```jsx
<Asset type="image" src="image.jpeg" smartness={0} />
```

## Image Caching

By default, image assets are displayed using the standard browser `img` tag and browser caching sematics. However, when used as part of a virtual scroller
such as GridView or TableView, it is useful to control this behavior more carefully in order to avoid reloading images more than necessary as they
scroll in and out of view. In addition, since not all assets will be displayed initially, preloading images in advance of them scrolling into view
can make for a better experience.

In order to support this, the Asset component has a built in image cache. It is turned off by default because it requires CORS headers to be enabled
on images by the server. If your backend supports CORS, you can enable image caching using the `cache` prop.

```jsx
<Asset type="image" src="image.jpeg" cache />
```

In addition to this, Asset supports the `placeholder` prop, which if already in the cache, will display while the full size image in the `src` prop
is loading. This is useful if you preload small size images in advance and only load the large size ones when they scroll into view, for example.
Or perhaps in a grid view, you display a lower resolution image than on your detail page that you can display while the full size image is loading.

```jsx
<Asset type="image" src="fullsize.jpeg" cache placeholder="thumbnail.jpeg" />
```

## Headers and Authentication

Sometimes images require authentication in order to fetch them from a server. Unless this is cookie or query string based, there is no way to do this
using a standard `img` tag, for example using an `Authorization` header. The Asset component supports a `headers` prop to add headers to the
request using the same infrastructure as the image cache. Therefore, assets requested with headers are implictly cached the same way as using the `cache`
prop, and require CORS headers to be enabled as well.

```jsx
<Asset type="image" src="image.jpeg" headers={{Authorization: 'token'}} />
```

## Internationalization

To internationalize an Asset, a localized string should be passed to the `alt` prop of the asset.

## Accessibility

The `alt` prop should be used to specify alternate content for screen readers.

### Images

All images that are neither decorative nor having alternative text that would be redundant with displayed text, must use the `alt` prop to provide alternate content for screen readers.

```jsx
<Asset
  type="image"
  src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06640.jpg"
  alt="Sunset view of Paris featuring the Eiffel Tower as seen from the
  Montparnasse Tower 56th Floor Observation Deck" />
```

<div style={{'width':'208px', 'height':'208px'}}>
  <Asset type="image" src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06640.jpg" alt="Sunset view of Paris featuring the Eiffel Tower as seen from the Montparnasse Tower 56th Floor Observation Deck" />
</div>

### Default label for File

By default, an Asset that displays a file uses the localized string "File" as an accessibility label.

```jsx
<Asset type="file" />
```
<div style={{'width':'208px', 'height':'208px'}}>
  <Asset type="file" />
</div>

Use the `alt` prop to override the default "File" label.

```jsx
<Asset type="file" alt="Document" />
```
<div style={{'width':'208px', 'height':'208px'}}>
  <Asset type="file" alt="Document" />
</div>

### Default label for Folder

By default, an Asset that displays a folder uses the localized string "Folder" as an accessibility label.

```jsx
<Asset type="folder" />
```
<div style={{'width':'208px', 'height':'208px'}}>
  <Asset type="folder" />
</div>

Use the `alt` prop to override the default "Folder" label.

```jsx
<Asset type="file" alt="File Folder" />
```
<div style={{'width':'208px', 'height':'208px'}}>
  <Asset type="file" alt="File Folder" />
</div>

### Decorative

Use the `decorative` prop to indicate that the image is decorative, or redundant with displayed text, and should not announced by screen readers.

```jsx
<Asset type="image" src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06640.jpg" decorative />

<Asset type="file" decorative />

<Asset type="folder" decorative />
```
<div style={{'width':'208px', 'height':'208px'}}>
  <Asset type="image" src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06640.jpg" decorative />
</div>
<div style={{'width':'208px', 'height':'208px'}}>
  <Asset type="file" decorative />
</div>
<div style={{'width':'208px', 'height':'208px'}}>
  <Asset type="folder" decorative />
</div>
