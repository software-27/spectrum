# September 30, 2024 Release
Happy fall! üçÅ We‚Äôre excited to announce that our color picker components are now generally available! This includes [ColorPicker](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/ColorPicker.html), [ColorArea](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/ColorArea.html), [ColorField](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/ColorField.html), [ColorSlider](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/ColorSlider.html), [ColorSwatch](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/ColorSwatch.html), [ColorSwatchPicker](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/ColorSwatchPicker.html), and [ColorWheel](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/ColorWheel.html). These enable you to build fully customizable color pickers, including accessible color descriptions for screen reader support.

In addition, we‚Äôve introduced a new [pending state](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html#pending) for buttons in React Aria Components, allowing you to display a progress spinner to indicate that an action is in progress. It also handles screen reader announcements and disables other interactions, except for focus, during the pending state.

We're also advancing the React Aria Components [Tree](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Tree.html) and Spectrum [TreeView](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/TreeView.html) to beta, and have added some basic documentation. In alpha, we have new [Disclosure](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Disclosure.html) and [DisclosureGroup](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/DisclosureGroup.html) components in React Aria Components, which can be used to build accordions and other collapsible panels.

Huge thanks as always to everyone who contributed to this release! üòç

### Accordion updates

We have made improvements to the Accordion component, which includes moving away from the Collection API in favor of wrapping `Disclosure` components, which can be used standalone. This includes a few breaking changes.
- `Item` has been replaced with the `Disclosure` component, which consists of two children: `DisclosureHeader` and `DisclosurePanel`
- `title` on `Item` is now a child of `DisclosureHeader`
- Children of `Item` is now children of `DisclosurePanel`
- `key` on `Item` is now `id` on `Disclosure`
- `disabledKeys` has been removed in favor of adding `isDisabled` on individual `Disclosure` components
- `allowsMultipleExpanded` can be added to allow multiple Disclosure components to be expanded at once (previously default behavior)
