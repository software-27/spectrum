# Collections

Many components display a collection of items, and provide functionality such as keyboard
navigation, selection, and more. React Aria has a consistent, compositional API to define the items
displayed in these components.

## Introduction

Many React Aria components display a collection of items of some kind. For example, lists, menus, selects,
tables, trees, and grids. These collections can usually be navigated with the keyboard using arrow keys, and
many have some form of selection. Many support loading data asynchronously, updating that data over time,
virtualized scrolling for performance with large collections, and more.

React Aria implements a JSX-based API for defining collections. This is an intuitive way to provide
items with rich contents and various options as props. Building hierarchical
collections, e.g. sections, or a tree of items is also very natural in JSX. React Aria provides a
consistent API across many types of collection components that is easy to learn, performant with large
collections, and extensible for advanced features.

## Static collections

A **static collection** is a collection that does not change over time (e.g. hard coded). This is common for
components like action menus where the items are built into the application rather than representing user data.

```tsx
<Menu>
  <MenuItem>Open</MenuItem>
  <MenuItem>Edit</MenuItem>
  <MenuItem>Delete</MenuItem>
</Menu>
```

### Sections

Sections or groups of items can be constructed by wrapping the items in a `<Section>` element. A `<Header>` can also be
rendered within a `<Section>` to provide a section title.

```tsx
<Menu>
  <Section>
    <Header>Styles</Header>
    <MenuItem>Bold</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem>Underline</MenuItem>
  </Section>
  <Section>
    <Header>Align</Header>
    <MenuItem>Left</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem>Middle</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem>Right</MenuItem>
  </Section>
</Menu>
```

## Dynamic collections

Static collections are great when the items never change, but how about dynamic data? A **dynamic collection**
is a collection that is based on data, for example from an API. In addition, it may change over time as
items are added, updated, or removed from the collection by a user.

React Aria implements a JSX-based interface for dynamic collections, which maps over your data and
applies a function for each item to render it. The following example shows how a collection can be
rendered based on dynamic data, stored in React state.

```tsx
let [animals, setAnimals] = useState([
  {id: 1, name: 'Aardvark'},
  {id: 2, name: 'Kangaroo'},
  {id: 3, name: 'Snake'}
]);

<ListBox items={animals}>
  {item => <ListBoxItem>{item.name}</ListBoxItem>}
</ListBox>
```

As you can see, the items are passed to the `items` prop of the top-level component, which iterates over each
item and calls the function passed as children to the component. The item object is passed to the function, which
returns a `<ListBoxItem>`.

### Unique ids

All items in a collection must have a unique id, which is used to determine what items in the collection changed
when updates occur. By default, React Aria looks for an `id` property on each item object, which is often returned
from a database. You can also specify a custom id on each item element using the `id` prop. For example, if all animals in the
example had a unique `name` property, then each item's `id` could be set to `item.name` to use it as the unique id.

```tsx
let [animals, setAnimals] = useState([
  {name: 'Aardvark'},
  {name: 'Kangaroo'},
  {name: 'Snake'}
]);

<ListBox items={animals}>
  {item => <ListBoxItem id={item.name}>{item.name}</ListBoxItem>}
</ListBox>
```

### Why not array map?

You may be wondering why we didn't use `animals.map` in this example.
In fact, this works just fine, but it's less performant, and you must remember to provide both a React `key` and an `id` prop.

```tsx
let [animals, setAnimals] = useState([
  {name: 'Aardvark'},
  {name: 'Kangaroo'},
  {name: 'Snake'}
]);

<ListBox>
  {animals.map(item =>
    <ListBoxItem key={item.name} id={item.name}>{item.name}</ListBoxItem>
  )}
</ListBox>
```

Using the `items` prop and providing a render function allows React Aria to automatically cache the results
of rendering each item and avoid re-rendering all items in the collection when only one of them changes. This
has big performance benefits for large collections.

### Updating data

When you need to update the data to add, remove, or change an item, you can do so using a standard React state update.

**Important**: all items passed to a collection component must be immutable. Changing a property on an item, or calling
`array.push()` or other mutating methods will not work as expected.

The <TypeLink links={dataDocs.links} type={dataDocs.exports.useListData} /> hook can be used to manage the
data and state for a list of items, and update it over time. It will also handle removing items from the selection
state when they are removed from the list. See the [useListData](../react-stately/useListData.html) docs for more details.

The following example shows how you might append a new item to the list.

```tsx
import {useListData} from '@react-stately/data';

let list = useListData({
  initialItems: [
    {name: 'Aardvark'},
    {name: 'Kangaroo'},
    {name: 'Snake'}
  ],
  initialSelectedKeys: ['Kangaroo'],
  getKey: item => item.name
});

function addAnimal(name) {
  list.append({name});
}

<ListBox items={list.items}>
  {item => <ListBoxItem id={item.name}>{item.name}</ListBoxItem>}
</ListBox>
```

Note that `useListData` is a convenience hook, not a requirement. You can use any state management library to manage collection items.

### Sections

Sections can be built by returning a `<Section>` instead of an item from the top-level item renderer. Sections
also support an `items` prop and a render function for their children. If the section also has a header,
the <TypeLink links={docs.links} type={docs.exports.Collection} /> component can be used to render the child items.

```tsx
let [sections, setSections] = useState([
  {
    name: 'People',
    items: [
      {name: 'David'},
      {name: 'Same'},
      {name: 'Jane'}
    ]
  },
  {
    name: 'Animals',
    items: [
      {name: 'Aardvark'},
      {name: 'Kangaroo'},
      {name: 'Snake'}
    ]
  }
]);

<ListBox items={sections}>
  {section =>
    <Section id={section.name}>
      <Header>{section.name}</Header>
      <Collection items={section.children}>
        {item => <ListBoxItem id={item.name}>{item.name}</ListBoxItem>}
      </Collection>
    </Section>
  }
</ListBox>
```

When updating nested data, be sure that all parent items change accordingly. Items are immutable,
so don't use mutating methods like push, or replace a property on a parent item. Instead, copy
the items that changed as needed.

#### useTreeData

The <TypeLink links={dataDocs.links} type={dataDocs.exports.useTreeData} /> hook can be used to
manage data and state for a tree of items. This is similar to `useListData`, but with support for
hierarchical data. Like `useListData`, `useTreeData` will also handle automatically
removing items from the selection when they are removed from the list.
See the [useTreeData](../react-stately/useTreeData.html) docs for more details.

```tsx
import {useTreeData} from '@react-stately/data';

let tree = useTreeData({
  initialItems: [
    {
      name: 'People',
      items: [
        {name: 'David'},
        {name: 'Sam'},
        {name: 'Jane'}
      ]
    },
    {
      name: 'Animals',
      items: [
        {name: 'Aardvark'},
        {name: 'Kangaroo'},
        {name: 'Snake'}
      ]
    }
  ],
  getKey: item => item.name,
  getChildren: item => item.items
});

function addPerson(name) {
  tree.append('People', {name});
}

<ListBox items={tree.items}>
  {node =>
    <Section id={section.name} items={node.children}>
      <Header>{section.name}</Header>
      <Collection items={section.children}>
        {item => <ListBoxItem id={item.name}>{item.name}</ListBoxItem>}
      </Collection>
    </Section>
  }
</ListBox>
```

Note that `useTreeData` is a utility hook, not a requirement. You can use any state management library to manage collection items.


## Asynchronous loading

The <TypeLink links={dataDocs.links} type={dataDocs.exports.useAsyncList} /> hook can be
used to manage async data loading from an API. Pass a `load` function to `useAsyncList`, which returns the items
to render. You can use whatever data fetching library you want, or the built-in
[fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API. See the [useAsyncList](../react-stately/useAsyncList.html) docs for more details.

This example fetches a list of Pokemon from an API and displays them in a Select.

```tsx
import {useAsyncList} from '@react-stately/data';

let list = useAsyncList({
  async load({signal}) {
    let res = await fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon', {signal});
    let json = await res.json();
    return {items: json.results};
  }
});

<Select>
  <Label>Pick a Pokemon</Label>
  <Button>
    <SelectValue />
  </Button>
  <Popover>
    <ListBox items={list.items}>
      {item => <ListBoxItem id={item.name}>{item.name}</ListBoxItem>}
    </ListBox>
  </Popover>
</Select>
```

Note that `useAsyncList` is a convenience hook, not a requirement. You can use any state management or data loading
library to manage collection items.

## Hooks

If you're using React Aria and React Stately hooks rather than components, the collection API is slightly different.
See the [React Stately collections](../react-stately/collections.html) documentation for more details.
