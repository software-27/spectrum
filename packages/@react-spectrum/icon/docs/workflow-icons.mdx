# Workflow Icons

Workflow icons are graphical metaphors or symbols that can be used to compliment existing experiences.

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={workflowIconPackageData}
  sourceData={[
    {type: 'Spectrum', url: 'https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/iconography/'}
  ]} />

## Example

```tsx example
import Airplane from '@spectrum-icons/workflow/Airplane';

<Airplane />
```

## Sizing

Icons support t-shirt sizing. When used inside another React Spectrum component, they'll generally be sized automatically,
but if you use icons standalone, you can use the `size` prop to control the sizing. The default size is "M" in medium scale
(desktop), and "L" in large scale (mobile).

```tsx example
import Beaker from '@spectrum-icons/workflow/Beaker';

<Beaker size="XXS" />
<Beaker size="XS" />
<Beaker size="S" />
<Beaker size="M" />
<Beaker size="L" />
<Beaker size="XL" />
<Beaker size="XXL" />
```

## Labeling

By default, icons are considered decorative, and are hidden from assistive technology. When used within a component like a button
that has no label, an `aria-label` should be provided to the parent component. If used standalone, an `aria-label` can be provided
to the icon itself.

```tsx example
import LockClosed from '@spectrum-icons/workflow/LockClosed';

<LockClosed aria-label="Locked" />
```

## Available Icons

```tsx snippet
<IconTable iconPackage="workflow" />
```
