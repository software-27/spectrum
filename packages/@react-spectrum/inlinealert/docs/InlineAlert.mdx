# InlineAlert

<PageDescription>{docs.exports.InlineAlert.description}</PageDescription>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['InlineAlert']}
  sourceData={[
    {type: 'Spectrum', url: 'https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/in-line-alert/'}
  ]} />

## Example

```tsx example
<InlineAlert>
  <Header>Payment Information</Header>
  <Content>Enter your billing address, shipping address, and payment method to complete your purchase.</Content>
</InlineAlert>
```

## Content

Inline alerts contain a title and body. They also include an icon for non-neutral variants.

```tsx example
<InlineAlert variant="positive">
  <Header>Payment Information</Header>
  <Content>Enter your billing address, shipping address, and payment method to complete your purchase.</Content>
</InlineAlert>
```

### Accessibility

Inline alerts are given the [alert role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/alert_role), which means they should only be used for information that requires the user's immediate attention.

### Internationalization

To internationalize an InlineAlert, localized strings should be set as the title and body content of the InlineAlert.
For languages that are read right-to-left (e.g. Hebrew and Arabic), the InlineAlert is automatically flipped.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.InlineAlert} links={docs.links} />

## Visual options

### Variant
[View guidelines](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/in-line-alert/#Options)

When inline alerts have a semantic meaning, they should use the appropriate variant.
The default variant is neutral, and should be used when the message is neutral in tone or when its semantics do not fit any of the other variants.

#### Informative

```tsx example
<InlineAlert variant="info">
  <Header>Accepted Payment Methods</Header>
  <Content>Only major credit cards are accepted for payment. Direct debit is currently unavailable.</Content>
</InlineAlert>
```

#### Positive

```tsx example
<InlineAlert variant="positive">
  <Header>Purchase completed</Header>
  <Content>You'll get a confirmation email with your order details shortly.</Content>
</InlineAlert>
```

#### Notice

```tsx example
<InlineAlert variant="notice">
  <Header>Update payment information</Header>
  <Content>The saved credit card for your account has expired. Update your payment information to complete the purchase.</Content>
</InlineAlert>
```

#### Negative

```tsx example
<InlineAlert variant="negative">
  <Header>Unable to process payment</Header>
  <Content>There was an error processing your payment. Please check that your credit card information is correct, then try again.</Content>
</InlineAlert>
```
