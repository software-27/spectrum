# Link

<PageDescription>{docs.exports.Link.description}</PageDescription>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['Link']}
  sourceData={[{type: 'Spectrum', url: 'https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/link/'}]}
  since="3.0.0" />

## Example

```tsx example
<Link href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6348138/" target="_blank">The missing link.</Link>
```

## Content


Links accept content as children. If the link has an href prop, it will be rendered as an `<a>` element.

```tsx example
<Link href="https://adobe.com" target="_blank">Adobe.com</Link>
```

### JavaScript handled links

When a `<Link`> does not have an `href` prop, it is rendered as a `<span role="link">` instead of an `<a>`. Events will need to be handled in JavaScript with the `onPress` prop.

Note: this will not behave like a native link. Browser features like context menus and open in new tab will not apply.

```tsx example
<Link onPress={() => alert('Pressed link')}>Adobe</Link>
```

### Client side routing

The `<Link>` component works with frameworks and client side routers like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main). As with other React Spectrum components that support links, this works via the [Provider](Provider.html) component at the root of your app. See the [client side routing guide](routing.html) to learn how to set this up.

### Internationalization

In order to internationalize a link, a localized string should be passed to the `children` prop.

### Accessibility

When an `href` is not provided, the link component will expose the accessible role to assistive technology as a "link".

```tsx example
<Link onPress={e => alert(`clicked "${e.target.textContent}" Link`)}>
  I forgot my password
</Link>
```

Be mindful of what the experience is for users navigating with screen readers. Make sure to give enough context about where the link will take the user.

The quiet style must only be used when the placement and context of the link is explicit enough that a visible underline isnâ€™t necessary. It must not be used within, for example, a paragraph of text.
