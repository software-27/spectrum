# Badge

<PageDescription>{docs.exports.Badge.description}</PageDescription>

<HeaderInfo
packageData={packageData}
componentNames={['Badge']}
sourceData={[
{type: 'Spectrum', url: 'https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/badge/'}
]}
since="3.22.0" />

## Example

```tsx example
<Badge variant="positive">Licensed</Badge>
```

## Content

Badges can have a label, an icon, or both. An icon is provided by passing an icon component as a child to the Badge.
A visible label can be provided by passing a string or a Text component as a child, depending on whether the Badge has an accompanying icon.

```tsx example
import {Text} from '@react-spectrum/text';
import CheckmarkCircle from '@spectrum-icons/workflow/CheckmarkCircle';

<Badge variant="positive">
  <CheckmarkCircle />
  <Text>Icon + Label</Text>
</Badge>
```

### Accessibility
If a visible label isn't specified, an `aria-label` must be provided for accessibility.

### Internationalization

To internationalize a Badge, a localized string should be set as the child content of the Badge.
For languages that are read right-to-left (e.g. Hebrew and Arabic), the Badge is automatically flipped.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Badge} links={docs.links} />

### Variant
[View guidelines](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/badge/#Semantic-variants)

When badges have a semantic meaning, they should use semantic colors.
Use the appropriate color to indicate status as follows.

```tsx example
import {Flex} from '@react-spectrum/layout';

<Flex direction="column" gap={8}>
  <Badge variant="positive">Green: Approved, Complete, Success, New, Purchased, Licensed</Badge>
  <Badge variant="info">Blue: Active, In Use, Live, Published</Badge>
  <Badge variant="negative">Red: Error, Alert, Rejected, Failed</Badge>
  <Badge variant="neutral">Gray: Archived, Deleted, Paused, Draft, Not Started, Ended</Badge>
</Flex>
```

When badges are used to color code categories, they use label colors. The ideal usage for these is when there
are 8 or fewer categories being color coded.

```tsx example
import {Flex} from '@react-spectrum/layout';

<Flex direction="column" gap={8}>
  <Badge variant="seafoam">Seafoam</Badge>
  <Badge variant="indigo">Indigo</Badge>
  <Badge variant="purple">Purple</Badge>
  <Badge variant="fuchsia">Fuchsia</Badge>
  <Badge variant="magenta">Magenta</Badge>
  <Badge variant="yellow">Yellow</Badge>
</Flex>
```
