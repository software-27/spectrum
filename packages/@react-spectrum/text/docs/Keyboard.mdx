## Content

Keyboard is used to format text indicating that is a keyboard
command. Based on the component it is used within, it gets Spectrum styling
and may have a preassigned slot for positioning. By virtue of its name, the
Keyboard component provides semantic meaning in the context they are placed.
An example of its usage in [Menu](MenuTrigger.html#complex-menu-items).
It is important to note that the Keyboard component accepts any renderable
node, not just strings.

See [the MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd) for more information.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Keyboard} links={docs.links} />
