*Be sure to update the W3C url below if applicable to your hook, otherwise omit the sourceData prop.*

  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['useList']}
  sourceData={[
    {type: 'W3C', url: 'https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#button'}
  ]} />

## API

*Include an additional FunctionAPI if multiple hooks are being documented in a single file. See useTabList.mdx for an example.*
## Features

*Describe what the aria hook helps with/provides.*

## Anatomy/Usage

*For hooks that are meant to be used with specific elements/components, include an Anatomy section detailing the props the hook returns. See useColorField.mdx for an example.*
*If applicable, the anatomy diagram should be added as a local svg file, sourced from the Spectrum XD file (ask Devon for the file if you are unsure). Follow these steps after you obtain the XD file:*
*1. Open the XD file and find the anatomy diagram. Select it by double clicking its artboard.*
*2. Export it as an SVG via File -> Export -> Selected...*
*3a. Manually remove any extraneous Spectrum-only elements and labels from the SVG.*
*3b. Replace the colors in the SVG with their spectrum color variable equivalents. See docs.css .provider for a mapping of these colors.*
*3c. Add a `title` and `desc` to the SVG summarizing the contents of the diagram. See any of existing anatomy.svg for an example. *

*For hooks that are meant for more general use, include a Usage section instead detailing the props/params the hook accepts and returns. See useKeyboard.mdx for an example.*


## Example

*Add an example of the hook (being used with native elements, etc)*
*If you create an example component that will be reused else where in this doc, include export=true so that you can directly reuse the component and avoid copy pasting the same code.*
*See useComboBox.mdx for an example.*

## Usage

*For hooks that are meant to be used with specific elements/components, include this usage section detailing examples of how to use the hook. *
*This should roughly mirror the examples that the corresponding React Spectrum component docs have (e.g. Controlled/Uncontrolled, Disabled, change handlers, etc). *

## Internationalization

*Mention if RTL *
