# React Aria Components + Spectrum + Tailwind CSS

A Tailwind CSS template for creating React Aria Components using common Spectrum styles.

## Overview

### Includes

- `Theme`: a preset that includes Spectrum values for colors, scale and more
- `Plugin`: for easier styling based on React Aria Component's selectors for states

### When to use this

- You need a component that matches an ARIA pattern, but doesn't exist in React Spectrum
- You are prototyping a component that might be a good fit for a future addition to React Spectrum, but isn't available yet

### When not to use this

- There is an existing React Spectrum component that matches your needs
- You are trying to override Spectrum guidelines or create a slight variation of an existing React Spectrum component

### Note

This is not a library you can install and consume, but rather a template that you can copy into your own project and maintain yourself. Keep in mind that you are still responsible for ensuring the experiences you create are accessible and meet Spectrum guidelines.
